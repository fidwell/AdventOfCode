# Advent of Code

My implementations for the yearly Advent of Code puzzle series.

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

See details at [https://adventofcode.com/](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Puzzle input

All of my solutions read puzzle input from a common `input` directory in the
repository's root folder. Sample data from each puzzle is included, but my own
personal input files are not. If you'd like to run your own, they should go in
the `input` folder alongside the sample input. They should be named
`puzzle01.txt`, `puzzle02.txt`, etc. See the README in each language's
subdirectory for further instructions.

## Other resources

I wrote a custom user style for the AoC website that makes it a bit more
readable. You can download it [here](https://gist.github.com/fidwell/be068bd68deca0445d41cf497ef78773).
I recommend using [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) in your browser
to apply the stylesheet.
